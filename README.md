# Tic-Tac-Toe
Made tic tac toe game using HTML CSS and JavaScript.

winningPattern = [
  [0, 1, 2],
  [0, 3, 6],
  [0, 4, 8],
  [1, 4, 7],
  [2, 4, 6],
  [2, 5, 8],
  [3, 4, 5],
  [6, 7, 8],
];

1. Using forEach loop on the boxes(selected or mapped using querySelectorAll)
    which will allow users to click on each boxes and will display X or Y simultaneously.
2. Looping through the winning pattern to find the winning pattern on each boxes.
    for(let pattern of winningPattern) {
      main goal is to make box[0] which is index of the boxes
       1. pattern[0]    -> this gives the first col of winning Pattern
       2. boxes[pattern[0]] -> basically it is boxes[0]
       3. boxes[pattern[0]].innerText  => will give either X or O

   if (value1 != "" && value2 != "" && value3 != "") {
      if (value1 === value2 && value2 === value3) {
        // console.log(`winner: ${value1}`);
        displayWinnerFunc(value1);
        messageBox.classList.remove("hide");
      }
    }
   }
   THIS WILL CHECK THE CONDITION AND DISPLAYS THE FINAL WINNER
    (displayWinnerFunc(value1) THIS FUNCTION DOES THAT)
